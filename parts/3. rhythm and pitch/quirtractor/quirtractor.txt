QUIRTRACTOR
===========

This is your basic steparound-style S&H pair except equipped with a feedback circuit, so that the CV out also controls the sawtooth oscillator rate. All kinds of patterns appear and disappear. It works great.



L-R:

LLFO #1 produces pulses for PULSE DIVIDER and MULT #2

PULSE DIVIDER divides these pulses and sends trigger to S&H 1 - and also to MULT #1

S&H #1 samples output of LLFO #2 and passes it to VCA #2 for attenuation - and also to MULT #1

VCA #1 displays the present voltage from S&H #1

VCA #2 attenuates voltage from S&H #1 for return to LLFO #2 v/oct input 

LLFO #2 makes sawtooth waves for sampling, and modulates itself (with some chaperoning)

S&H #2 samples LLFO #2's sawtooth to MULT #2 and VCA #3

MULT outputs triggers and CV, 0-10v
